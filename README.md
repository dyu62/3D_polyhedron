# PolyhedronNet: Representation Learning for Polyhedra with Surface-attributed Graph

This is the **official repository** for our **ICLR 2025 paper**:  
**"PolyhedronNet: Representation Learning for Polyhedra with Surface-attributed Graph"**

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

PolyhedronNet introduces an innovative representation learning framework for **3D geometries**, utilizing **surface-attributed graphs** to efficiently encode complex 3D structures. This approach extends polygon-based graph learning techniques into the polyhedral domain, enabling a wide range of applications in **computational geometry, urban modeling, and shape analysis**.

For **2D polygon/multipolygon encoding**, please refer to our related work:
